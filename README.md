# My Boy Suga

## Tl;dr: clean dataset for further NLP analyses. Example project. 

This repository contains an already processed, scraped tweets csv from Japan Minister Yoshihide Suga's official Twitter account. 
I also included my take on sentiment analysis on his tweets. Rather than using Twitter's API to scrape the tweets, I used Twint,
as it can 

1) fetch all Tweets made by PM Suga.
2) be used anonymously.
3) no rate limitations.

Further cleaning of the data was done using R, and data column translation from 'ja' to 'en' was done through Google Sheets.

My project includes Sentiment Analysis of Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's tweets in both English &amp; Japanese.
Credited below is Hironsan and Asari, a Japanese sentiment analyzer implemented in Python. Please note that
one of Asari's dependencies, Janome, a morphological analysis engine, is only supported by Python 3.6 and below, so one way
to navigate through this is to downgrade from Janome 0.4.1 to Janome 0.3.7. 


For your personal project, I've uploaded the dataset onto
https://www.kaggle.com/andresha/yoshihide-suga-tweets-sugawitter. 
Would love to see what insights you all come up with. 


```
pip install "Janome == 0.3.7"

```
